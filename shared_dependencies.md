Shared Dependencies:

1. **Database Connection**: Both the framework and web app will share the same database connection. This will be defined in a shared module and imported into the necessary files.

2. **User Schema**: The user schema will be defined in the user_auth.py file and will be used in the main.py, dashboard.py, deploy_scrapers.py, data_view.py, and logs_metrics.py files.

3. **Scraper Task Schema**: The scraper task schema will be defined in the scraper.py file and will be used in the main.py, distributed.py, queue.py, scheduler.py, api.py, and data_storage.py files.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: The front-end files (dashboard.py, deploy_scrapers.py, data_view.py, logs_metrics.py) will share DOM element IDs for user interaction and data display.

5. **API Endpoints**: The api.py file will define the API endpoints, which will be used in the web app files for data retrieval and task management.

6. **Error Messages**: The error_handler.py file will define error messages, which will be used across the framework and web app files for error handling.

7. **Function Names**: Function names will be shared across the framework and web app files for task management, data retrieval, error handling, and user authentication.

8. **Test Cases**: The test files will share test cases for their corresponding main files. They will import the main files and use their functions and classes for testing.

9. **Requirements**: The requirements.txt file will list all the dependencies required for both the framework and the web app. This will be shared across all files.

10. **Documentation**: The README.md file will contain setup instructions and API endpoints, which will be shared across all files for reference.
